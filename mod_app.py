The app allows users to easily type a company's ticker symbol as listed on Yahoo Finance, 
the date range and then the app will run that through the model to predict the closing stock price for the selected date(s). 
The model is trained and tested on the historical stock price data from Yahoo Finance.
The results are presented in the form of a table and graph with a 95% confidence interval of the predicted stock price.

**Disclaimer:**  
Kindly be advised that the creator of this app is not a financial expert and does not offer any investment recommendations. 
The sole aim of this app is to showcase the Machine Learning process using tools and techniques such as GitHub, Python, and Streamlit.
